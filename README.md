# idx-tracking-GAN
- Run main_multiple.py to train multiple GANs and get their models (for a single run, it saves models according to epoch_checkpoint and epoch_checkpoint delta)....
- Run main_gan_results to get some simulations and loss screenshots
- Run GA_main to get and write GA solutions, and
- Run GA_results to read GA results and generate plots for them
- Run GA_benchmark to get and write benchmark GA solutions
- Run GA_benchmark_results to read benchmark GA results and generate plots for them
- Run GA_main_model_eval to evaluate the convergence of the GAs
